    "In this Notebook, you will use real astronomy data to explore the relationship between galaxy properties and the large-scale structure of the Universe. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, you should have found an answer to the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* How are galaxies spatially distributed in the Universe?\n",
    "* Are galaxies all the same colour?\n",
    "* Are galaxies all the same shape?\n",
    "* How are galaxies' colours and shapes related to their spacial distribution?\n",

    "You will answer the above questions yourself, by exploring the largest astronomical dataset in the world - the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (www.sdss.org). You will interact directly with the data by running Python commands inside this online notebook in the SciServer virtual computing environment. That means you can work with the largest astronomical dataset in the world using only your web browser.\n",

    "The SDSS stores its data in an online database. You can communicate with the database by sending \"queries\" written in Structured Query Language (SQL). For each query command, the database returns an answer. Usually, the answer will be a subsample of the original database, though SQL can operate on the data very effectively too. \n",

    "\n",
    "In short, every SQL command consists of three blocks: \n",
    "- The **SELECT** block: it defines the quantities that you want your query to return.\n",
    "- The **FROM** block: it defines which tables of the database you want SQL to look in.\n",
    "- The **WHERE** block: it defines any constraints on the data that you want to impose.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make your map of the Universe (Part 1 of this activity), you won't have to write SQL queries from scratch, only execute commands that are already written for you."
