# Astronomy 101 activities

A collection of SciServer activities appropriate students in introductory astronomy courses. You are welcome to use them as-is or adapt them for your students.

This directory contains notebooks with instructor notes and sample solutions, while the "student_versions" directory contains student instructions only.

This activity was created by Rita Tojeiro for an introductory astronomy course (AS1001) at University of St Andrews in October 2017.
